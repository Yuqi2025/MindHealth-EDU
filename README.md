# Integrating EEG Data into Mobile Health Education Applications to Enhance User Experience and Retention

Mobile health (mHealth) education has emerged as a transformative tool to promote public health by delivering scalable and personalized learning experiences. However, existing mHealth applications often face critical challenges, such as limited user engagement, low knowledge retention, and inadequate adaptation to diverse user needs.

This repository introduces the **Adaptive Personalized Health Education Model (APHEM)**, a data-driven framework designed to overcome these limitations. By integrating user modeling, multi-modal data analysis, and reinforcement learning, APHEM dynamically tailors educational content to enhance user experience and retention.

## Features

### Adaptive Personalized Health Education Model (APHEM)
- **User Modeling:** Leverages EEG data and other multi-modal inputs to create personalized user profiles.
- **Dynamic Adaptation:** Uses reinforcement learning to tailor educational content to individual preferences and needs.
- **Personalized Embeddings:** Incorporates user-specific data to ensure relevance and engagement.

### Interactive Engagement and Retention Strategy (IERS)
- **Gamification:** Enhances user engagement through game-like elements.
- **Spaced Repetition:** Improves long-term knowledge retention with scientifically validated learning strategies.
- **Context-Aware Adaptation:** Adjusts content delivery based on real-time feedback and environmental factors.

### Key Benefits
- Improved **user satisfaction** and engagement.
- Enhanced **learning outcomes** and knowledge retention.
- Increased **platform scalability** for diverse user populations.

## Experiments and Results
Extensive experiments conducted using this framework demonstrate:
- Significant improvement in user satisfaction scores.
- Enhanced learning outcomes, particularly in health knowledge retention.
- Scalability and adaptability across diverse user demographics.
